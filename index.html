	<h2>Current responsibilities</h2>Since September 2007, I'm a research director at INRIA Lille. I led the RMoD Team, and now the EVREF team. During 10 years, I co-directed with O. Nierstrasz the Software Composition Group. I'm the president of ESUG. I co-founded Synectique a company that offered specific tools for Software analysis. I'm one of the leader of Pharo: a new exciting dynamic language. Check the Pharo consortium. Here is a short CV. My ORCID Number is 0000-0001-6070-6599.<h2>Awards and Indexes</h2>Some people consider that h-index is not a good criteria for researcher evaluation. To me this is just one among others. Trying to understand it, it looks like it shows a bit the width of your research (i.e., that several topics got reasonance within a community). Personally I do not work with this metrics in mind, I just try to publish the best results I have with my co-workers and thank them for their energy. According to google scholar my h-index is 61 (schoolar.g).<ul><li>I got laureate 2023 of "Prix FIEEC Bpifrance de la Recherche appliquee 2023"</li><li>I got the "Test of Time ECOOP 2023" award for Traits: Composable Units of Behavior</li><li>I got the Most Influencial Paper of Vissoft 2013 for Performance Evolution Blueprint</li><li>I got laureate of ERC-Generator of I-Site financed by Programmes d'Investissements d'Avenir (I was the only CS researcher awarded).</li><li>Since December 2012, I was promoted first class Directeur de Recherche.</li><li>I received a "Prime d'excellence scientifique" from INRIA (2016).</li><li>I got distinguished Visiting Fellowship Award of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2011).</li><li>Veronica Uquillas Gomez won the Benevol most promising young research Award (2011).</li><li>Mariano Martinez-Peck and Martin Diaz won for Fuel the 2011 ESUG Technology Award.</li><li>Dynamic web development with Seaside: Our new free open-source Seaside book won the ESUG member 2010 best book Award.</li><li>Michele Lanza (2003) and Alexandre Bergel (2006) PhD theses won the Ernest Denert foundation for Software Engineering Award.</li><li>"Learning Programming with Robots" received the Award of PCPlus magazine of September 2005 and the Bitwise Recommended Award in February 2006.</li></ul><h2>Reflection about impact and real users</h2>Pharo 9.0 had 790 packages for 10658 classes and 143420 methods. It had around 250 forks on github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/">https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/</a> and Pharo is composed out of several github projects such as pharo-vcs, pharo-graphics, or pharo-spec. Pharo has around 18 regular contributors and up to 100 occasional ones. In addition Pharo has many users (we roughly estimate around 10 000) and Pharo is taught is around 30-40 universities worldwide and used by aroudn 30 research teams. It has also an industrial consortium. Pharo runs on 11 different platforms and multiple architectures 32/64 bits, / Intel/ARM.This raises the important question of how many citations is worth one real user (not one of our students). I do not have definitive answer on that point but it is important to understand that there is a Huge difference between a research prototype and a real system and Pharo is a real system with real customers. This requires a large development effort. We are lucky because Inria researcher evaluation takes this into account. Now this is an important question for funding agencies and any evaluation of my team.
