###Awards and Indexes

Some people consider that h-index is not a good criteria for researcher evaluation. To me this is just one among others. Trying to understand it, it looks like it shows a bit the width of your research (i.e., that several topics got reasonance within a community). Personally I do not work with this metrics in mind, I just try to publish the best results I have with my co-workers and thank them for their energy. According to google scholar my h-index is 61 (schoolar.g).
