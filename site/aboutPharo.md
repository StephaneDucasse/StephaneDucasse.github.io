# Pharo

[Pharo](http://www.pharo.org) is a beautiful dynamically-typed reflective pure object-oriented language that we have been developing since 2008.
It is inspired by Smalltalk (I'm extremely grateful to Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls - they were so visionary and right). Now our vision for Pharo is to reinvent Smalltalk 
and produce a better system. 
From that perspective, I'm used to say that Pharo is what we have and not what we want. 
In essence, Pharo is the beginning of the journey not the final goal. And you can change its future.

There are many aspects I would like to see being explored either by us or by others.
If you want to try some of the following aspects, I would be super excited about knowing about it and also understanding how to 
evolve Pharo into a better Pharo. 


## Some language challenges 

- Type inferencer: How can we benefits from type without the pain - how to adapt Castagna's work on type inference to Pharo.
- Isolation and capabilities: How can we provide more modularity within the language?
- Channels or how to revisit concurrency: can we improve the concurrent model (without falling into the actor model :))
- Parallelism (the story behind the global interpreter loop): how can we take advantage of multiple CPU?
- Microkernels (see the PhD of Guillermo Polito): how can we build different specific language kernels?
- Multiple language kernels running side by side
- Pharoish like language for IoT
- Dynamic inliner for our lovely VM
- Better integration with OS
- Pharo-based shell

## Some tool challenges

- We are strong believers of tests. Now how can we get more out of them?
- How can we "optimize" tests: reduce duplication, help developers navigate them? See my paper (Test Qualit yAssessment -- PDF)[https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/Team/Texts/Papers/Reic07aTestQualityAssessment.pdf]
- How can we better/faster debug programs? 


So if you are interested in doing a PhD or doing your own research on such topics, contact me so that we can exchange.
