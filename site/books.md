Over the years, I wrote the following books. I enjoyed it even if this is always more time-consuming than we would like. I also really have a lot of fun writing columns because this is a completely different exercise from scientific papers.

For the moment, I did not add the most recent books since you can find them at http://books.pharo.org/.

If you like my free books
- Buy them - Some are on https://www.amazon.com and https://www.decitre.fr
- Sponsor me :) (soon I will put back the paypal donate button)
- Send some money to the pharo association https://association.pharo.org

Thanks in advance.
