!! Actionable research

I'm doing and I'm a big big fan of what I discovered is called ""Actionable Analysis"". I love to work on the concrete problems of companies or open-source ecosystem such Pharo. 

I worked with Siemens, ATOS Wordline, Thales, Generali, Utocat on their problems.

I really like to build real systems because the devil is often in the details. This is why I love to code to improve Pharo. In addition it gives me a lot of research ideas such as semantic merging (PhD of V. Uquillas - Gomez), secondary memory (PhD of M. Martinez-Peck), bootstrap of reflective kernels (PhD of G. Polito), cycles and mutliple futures (PhD of J. Laval), program visualisation (PhD of M. Lanza), scoped extensions (PhD of A. Bergel and C. Teruel) and many others. 

In addition I always wonder as much publications is worth one real users of my research and code. Have a look my Software Language Engineering 2015 Keynote.
